This project has been implemented in my Ugoku-V2 Discord bot project and will not be updated anymore.

A super basic wrapper to decrypt songs from Deezer.

Simplified and modernized from the Deemix project: https://gitlab.com/RemixDev/deemix-py  
Some of the code (eg: chunked_input_stream.py) is from my Ugoku-v2 project.
